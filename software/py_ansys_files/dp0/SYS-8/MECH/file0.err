 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.953   TIME= 23:15:07
 Material property ALPX of material 8 is evaluated at a temperature of   
 22, which is below the supplied temperature range.  Temperature range   
 checking terminates.                                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.156   TIME= 23:15:08
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.703   TIME= 23:15:08
 Material number 13 (used by element 48411) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       5.766   TIME= 23:15:11
 Material property EX of material 3 of element 7088 is evaluated at a    
 temperature of 33.4962775, which is below the supplied temperature      
 range.  Temperature range checking terminates.                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      10.328   TIME= 23:15:18
 Contact element 48394 (real ID 11) has too much sliding distance        
 14.14138 relative to target element 48404.  Switch to finite sliding    
 logic (KEYOPT(18)=0) to better represent this situation if desired.
